## Objective

This project is an experiment designed to investigate the effects of two treatments on banana ripeness and taste:

Treatment 1: Storing bananas in a brown paper bag.
Treatment 2: Baking bananas for 5 minutes at 300 degrees Fahrenheit.
The primary goal is to determine whether these treatments impact banana ripeness and taste, and if there is any interaction effect between the two treatments.

## Hypotheses

We have formulated five hypotheses:

#### H1: The paper bag treatment impacts ripeness.
#### H2: Baking bananas for 5 minutes at 300 degrees impacts ripeness.
#### H3: There is an interaction effect between the paper bag and baking treatments.
#### H4: The paper bag treatment does not negatively impact taste.
#### H5: Baking bananas does not negatively impact taste.

## Experimental Design

### Sample Size:
The experiment uses 9 bunches of bananas, each containing 4 bananas (36 bananas total). Each treatment (paper bag, baking, both treatments combined, and a control) includes one banana from each bunch (9 bananas per treatment).
Ripeness and Taste Assessment:
Bananas will be tested across three parts, involving at least 3 participants in a single-blind setup:

### Taste:
Participants will sample the top half of the banana and rate its taste.

### Ripeness:
Participants will assess the ripeness by inspecting and tasting the bottom half of the banana.

Lugol's Iodine Test: This chemical test will measure starch content to determine ripeness objectively.
The participants will be in separate rooms, provide their assessments independently, and write down their responses to avoid bias.

## Statistical Analysis

Permutation Test:
Given that bananas from the same bunch are expected to be similar, the permutation test will be used to analyze differences between treatments within each bunch.
Ripeness Analysis:
An ANOVA will be performed if assumptions are met, with Tukey's post-hoc test if significant differences are found. If assumptions are violated, an appropriate non-parametric test will be used.
Taste Analysis:
The same approach as for ripeness will be applied to taste data.

## Daily Data Uploads:
Participant responses, including taste and ripeness ratings, as well as Lugol's iodine test results, will be uploaded daily in the data/ folder. This ensures the experiment is documented in real-time, and all data will be available for further analysis.
